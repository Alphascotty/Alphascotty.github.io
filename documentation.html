 <ul></ul> <h2> Below are the issues I encountered and how I solved them:</h2>
  <li> 
Poles Getting More Spaced Out After 10<br />
Issue: Obstacles seemed to be spaced further apart after a certain point in the game.<br />
Fix: Obstacle Spacing Adjustment: Added a fixed spacing interval (150 pixels) between sets of obstacles to maintain consistent spacing regardless of game speed.<br />
      <br />
  </li>
    
<li>
  Crash Sound Played After Game Over Alert<br />
Issue: The crash sound was played only after the game-over alert was shown, which was not the desired behavior.<br />
Fix: Timing Adjustment: Used setTimeout to delay the game-over alert by 500 milliseconds, allowing the crash sound to play completely before the game-over alert appears.<br />
    <br />
</li>

  <li>
 Game Speed Increase Frequency Issue<br />
Issue: The game speed increase was set to occur every 10000 units, which was too infrequent.<br />
Fix: Adjusted Speed Increase: Changed the frequency of speed increase to every 1000 units by modifying the speed increase logic to reflect every 10 score points (since 100 frames per point).<br />
      <br />
  </li>

  <li>
Background Music Pause and Resume Functionality<br />
Issue: Background music needed to pause and resume correctly with the pause button.<br />
Fix: Pause and Resume: Implemented togglePause() function to pause and resume the game and background music. The background music is paused when the game is paused and resumed when the game continues.<br />
      <br />
  </li>

  <li>
 Adjusting the Character Fit with Obstacles<br />
Issue: The gap between poles was not large enough to ensure the character could fit through.<br />
Fix: Obstacle Gap Adjustment: Modified the gap between obstacles to be at least 50 + myGamePiece.height to ensure the character fits through comfortably.<br />
      <br />
  </li>

  <li>
Crash Sound Timing During Collision<br />
Issue: Crash sound was not playing immediately upon collision. <br />
Fix: Immediate Crash Sound Play: Ensured the crash sound is played immediately when a collision is detected, before stopping the game.<br />
      <br />
  </li>
</ul>


    <h2> Plot </h2>

    <p> This is a 2D canvas game similar to that of flappy bird. The purpose of the game is to go as fasr as you can while avoiding obstacles(poles) or any projectiles. The challenge factor of the game is the speed at which your game piece starts to move every 10 points. I/ve coded it to double in spead at 10 units intervals.</p>
